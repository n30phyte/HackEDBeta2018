## AI Pong
For our project we decided to make an implementation of Pong that lets you play
against an AI player. To build Pong we used C++ and the SFML library. To make
the AI player we knew we wanted to use Python and reinforcement learning
techniques. After doing some research we found Andrej Karpathy's blog post (1) on
using policy gradients to solve the pong game found in the OpenAI Gym
environment. To allow us to use GPU acceleration we found a port of Andrej's
technique in Keras (2), a high level wrapper around Tensorflow. To train the
AI player we set up a Google Cloud Compute Engine with a single Tesla K80 GPU.
Additionally to allow the training done on the OpenAI Gym environment to
transfer to the C++ implementation of Pong we had to reverse engineer the
Gym inputs/outputs and build some processing scripts in Python to interface
with the model.
